      <p>Providing Simple. Interactive. Easy-to-use information about all your movie needs. “The mission of The Movie Reviewer is to provide an easy-to-use website that allows for any user to review, comment and make suggestions on past and present movies.
        It will provide a responsive experience that will work across all viewing devices. It allows readers to consume content easily and make their own judgments based on other individual’s experiences and opinions. In particular, The Movie Reviewer
        strives to create a platform that allows for the hard core online streamer, the traditional cinema goer, and the Netflix binger, a place to create conversation about interesting films. Each review entails a rating, the genre, movie posters and
        more - combined to create an all-in-one website that caters to individuals and their desired preferences on any genre of movie.”
