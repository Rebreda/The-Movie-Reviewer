<p> Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.
You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web
server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. </p>
